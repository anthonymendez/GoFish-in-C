Game Start
    Shuffle the Deck
    Deal 7 cards to each player (2 players for now)
For 3 players, it will 6 cards, 4 players it will be 5 cards, don’t worry about this for now
Player 1 (Human) Starts First
Main Game Loop (For each player p)
    Ask P for Rank R (if)
        Make sure Rank is in P’s hand (while)
        If true break
        If false, ask again for Rank in P’s hand
    Check other player’s hand (search)
        If they have R in their hand (if search == 1)
            Then transfer all to P’s hand (transfer cards)
            If P has a book (check add book)
remove from hand (remove_card)
increment score by 1 (P book fills up, done in check_add_book)
Check if P has 7 books
    True, end the game
    False, do nothing
            Go to top of Main Game Loop
        Else they don’t have R in their hand (else)
            Print “Go Fish Yourself Nerd!!!!! ahahahhahhahaahahahhaha”
            Then P must GoFish and pick a random card (deck next card probably)
        If P has book
remove from hand
increment score by 1
Check if P has 7 books
True, end the game
False, do nothing
    If player’s hand is empty
        Pick up 7 cards
Game Ends
    If human
        Print winning message
    Else
        Print losing message
    If human wants to play again
        Reset players
    Go to Game Start
